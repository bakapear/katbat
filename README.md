Upon first launch a `config.ini` file is generated.<br>
You can adjust various settings in the `[Settings]` and `[Config]` sections.<br>
Since the mouse itself does not give info about it's set settings, the `[Data]` section (read-only) keeps track of those.<br>

If you just need a simple battery tray with no menu, you can run the program in lite mode: `katbat.exe lite`, which will not produce a config file.
